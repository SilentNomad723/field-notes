# Field Notes Archive

This repository contains a personal archive of field observations, location logs, and visual documentation notes collected over a period of time. The purpose of maintaining this project is to preserve fragmented records from various locations in a structured and reproducible format.

The entries stored here do not follow a strict categorization model. Instead, they are maintained in chronological and thematic groupings based on observational context rather than geographic precision.

All materials included in this repository are part of an ongoing personal documentation effort. None of the content is intended for commercial use or redistribution.

## Project Scope

The scope of this archive includes:

- Informal visual records
- Environmental observations
- Structural and urban references
- Temporal notes captured during transit
- Cross-referenced fragments for later consolidation

Data is intentionally minimal and often fragmented. Some entries may appear incomplete. This is by design.

---

## Repository Layout

The repository is organized into the following primary components:

- `notes/` — Contains raw textual observations grouped by period.
- `misc/` — Stores reference fragments and auxiliary metadata.

The structure may evolve as new material is collected.

## Data Integrity

Each entry is preserved in its original form wherever possible. No artificial enhancement or cleanup has been applied to the majority of records. The intention is to maintain fidelity to the original capture conditions.

Minor formatting corrections may be introduced over time for readability.

---

## Encryption and Fragmentation

Some records are intentionally fragmented across different storage layers. This is done to prevent the complete reconstruction of sensitive trails from a single data source.
