April observational log.

Weather conditions were inconsistent throughout the capture period.
Intermittent lighting fluctuations affected visual clarity during multiple sessions.
Crowd density appeared higher during evening intervals.
No stable tracking pattern could be established from the available frames.

A potential pattern was suspected during mid-month review but no verifiable correlation could be confirmed after secondary analysis.

If you are reading this hoping to find the flag here…

Congratulations.
You found absolutely nothing.
Have a nice day.
