January observational log.

Initial recordings were carried out during the early transit windows, when movement within the monitored zone was minimal and environmental interference remained relatively low. 
These first sessions provided a clean baseline for the month, with most captures occurring under predictable conditions. 
Ambient light levels stayed within stable thresholds throughout the majority of the observation period, allowing for consistent exposure settings and reducing the need for mid‑session recalibration.

A small amount of frame noise was detected during low‑exposure captures, particularly in the pre‑dawn intervals where natural illumination dropped below optimal levels. 
The noise did not significantly impact subject visibility but was noted for future correction. Equipment diagnostics indicated no hardware faults; the distortion appears to be a natural consequence of the lighting environment rather than a mechanical issue.

Across all January sessions, no persistent anomalies were detected. 
Minor fluctuations in movement and lighting were observed, but none displayed the repetition or structure required to classify them as meaningful patterns. 
All collected data has been archived and catalogued for long‑term reference, forming the baseline against which subsequent months will be compared.

Further monitoring will continue as scheduled. No immediate follow‑up actions required at this stage.
